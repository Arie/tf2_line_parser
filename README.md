# TF2 line parser[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Arie/tf2_line_parser.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Arie/tf2_line_parser) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Arie/tf2_line_parser.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Arie/tf2_line_parser)

A TF2 log line parser. Unlike the other log parsers I've found, this one parses the line and returns a plain old ruby object to describe the event of the line.
I plan to use this for my own stats parsing tool.

## Requirements
* Ruby

## Credits
* nTraum, I stole the regexes from him his [TF2Stats](https://github.com/nTraum/tf2stats/) project.
