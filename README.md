# TF2 line parser

A TF2 log line parser. Unlike the other log parsers I've found, this one parses the line and returns a plain old ruby object to describe the event of the line.
I plan to use this for my own stats parsing tool.

## Requirements
* Ruby (no runtime dependencies)

## Credits
* nTraum, I stole most of the regexes from his [TF2Stats](https://github.com/nTraum/tf2stats/) project.
